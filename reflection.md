- What are your initial impressions of how `Association` affects your programming?
    At first it was intimidating thinking about how different classes would interact with one another but when I started thinking of it as a real train it made more sense to me. I was able to think about which were compositions, aggregations, and assocaitions. I thought of each class and what each method meant and how it referenced the things it "had". 

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
    What worked was taking it step by step so we wouldn't get overwhelmed. We set one day strictly to look over the assignment and read the instructions and genereate ideas. Then on the next day we implimented code and talked it out with one another to make sense of what and how we needed to make the methods. What didn't work was not looking over the slides to recap how associations work because it was a squishy topic but when I looked over it looking over the instructions made it easier to understand. I recommend students go to office hours, space out the work, collaborate with classmates, and look over the slides.
